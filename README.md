# REPFRAME v1.1

This is a Stata package that calculates Reproducibility and Replication Framework Indicators for multiverses of replication estimates. The package comes with two commands: `repframe` is the main command, and `repframe_gendata` generates a dataset that is used in the help file of the command to show examples of how the command works. 

The package can be installed by executing in Stata:
```
net install repframe, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guntherbensch/repframe/main") replace
```

Once installed, please see `help repframe` for the syntax and the whole range of options.
